# Chatroom
A simple chatroom made with sockets in Java to test what I have learned in Netwoking so far.

In order to run the project, you will need all of the files listed in the repository EXCEPT Main.java, ServerOld.java and ChatUser.java. Those are old files that I needed to test my code.
To actually start the chatroom, first run the terminal of Server.java and then run Client.java. (you can run multiple clients at once, each client is one chatroom user)

There are multiple commands that allow you to change your name in the chatroom, whisper to someone and also to exit the chatroom.
You may find the documentation of each command in ChatUserHandler.java.
